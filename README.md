ðŸ”¥ Wildfire Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on building an AI model to detect and classify wildfire-related conditions, with a special focus on distinguishing fog and smoke in images â€” a key challenge in real-time environmental monitoring.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
To develop a deep learning model capable of classifying images as "fire" or "no_fire", and to specifically analyze how well the model can distinguish fog from smoke, which often appear visually similar in natural scenes.

ðŸ§  Techniques Used
Transfer Learning using EfficientNetB0 (pretrained on ImageNet)

Image preprocessing and resizing for consistency

Data augmentation to simulate real-world variations (brightness, rotation, noise)

Categorical classification using softmax activation

Evaluation using training/validation accuracy, loss curves, and image-based testing

Model tuning with callbacks like ModelCheckpoint and ReduceLROnPlateau

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
Achieved ~95% training accuracy

Validation accuracy ranged from 60â€“85%, revealing overfitting

The model particularly struggles to distinguish fog from smoke

Future improvements will include regularization, better augmentation, and potentially fine-tuning deeper layers of EfficientNet
